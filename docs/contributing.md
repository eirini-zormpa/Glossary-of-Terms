# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the AIM Research Support Facility's Glossary of Terms 🎉

This repository is here to help folks get started collaborating on the AIM-RSF glossary of terms. We know that the field of AI and Medicine is huge (and continually expanding) so we hope that this is an area that will be consistently updated as the AIM project grows. The Glossary's contents are being developed ****openly**** and we invites contributions from ****anyone**** who wants to support the work of the AI for Multiple Long-Term Conditions Project.

### What is a "Contributor"

A contributor is anyone who suggests, creates, adds to, changes, updates, or reviews the material in this repository. Please refer to the [**Code of Conduct**](#code-of-conduct) section for information on what behaviours we expect of contributors.

A primary goal of our AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion. This document outlines our expectations for all those who participagit statte in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in the AIM RSF Community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

Please read through the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) below before contributing.

## Whatever your availability, there is a way to contribute to the Glossary.

💡 I'm new to contributing and don't know where to get started

Please familarize yourself with the AIM project and its goals. You can find information in our [Getting Started repository](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Getting-Started) or on [The Alan Turing Institute's website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility). Remember to read through the terms that already exist in the Glossary before suggesting a new one. 

If you see a term that you think should be updated but are new to collaborating on GitHub, you can read [this awesome blog post about how to start contributing to projects on GitHub](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution), **or** attend our monthly Collaboration Cafes hosted by the AIM RSF Community Managers. Reach out to sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk or ezormpa@turing.ac.uk for information on how to join the Collaboration Cafes.

You can contribute to this Glossary in 2 ways: **Pull Requests** or **Discussions**
- For community members who are new to GitHub, we suggest getting involved in Discussions.
  - You can suggest new terms that need to be added to the Glossary by commenting on the [Adding Terms to the Glossary](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Glossary-of-Terms/discussions/3) Discussion
  - Or you can add definitions by finding terms in the [Discussion List](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Glossary-of-Terms/discussions/3) that do not have definitions or citiations added to them.  
- If you are comfortable (or want to learn!) with Branches and Pull Requests, you can raise mistakes, add information, or offer content suggestions for the Glossary by opening a Pull Request.
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit fixes (for example: a typo, a broken link, or an obvious error)
  - Note: A Pull Request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line of the Pull Request. You can always add more commits to a PR later.

# Code of Conduct

## 1. Expected Behaviour

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people, and be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. 
* Treat everything as an opportunity to learn and accept responsibility and apologize to those affected by our mistakes when they occur. 
* Focus on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community. 


## 2. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying explicit or violent material.

* Personal insults and trolling on topics related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability. 
* Public or private harassment towards any members of our community. 
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission. Please refer to the [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for more information. 
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, and other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. 


## 3. Enforcement Responsibilities

The AIM RSF Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate. 

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. 

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, speaking on behalf of the AIM RSF, representing the AIM RSF or its activities at a conference or other public setting either online or offline.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. An formal apology may be requested. 

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. Project leaders will be notified and separate meetings may be set reflective of the severity of the behaviour. 

### 3. Ban from Community Events.

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from events, meetings, and forums used by the AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Research Support Facility (AIM RSF) to support the community. Further involvement in the AIM projects at large will be at the discretion of the individual consortium leaders upon advisement from AIM RSF Community leaders.
